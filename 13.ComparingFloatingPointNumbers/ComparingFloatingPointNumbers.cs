/*Write a program that safely compares floating-point numbers 
(double) with precision eps = 0.000001.
Note: Two floating-point numbers a and b cannot be compared directly 
by a == b because of the nature of the floating-point arithmetic. 
Therefore, we assume two numbers are equal if they are more closely 
to each other than a fixed constant eps.

Examples:
 Number a	Number b	Equal (with     Explanation
                        precision
                        eps=0.000001)
5.3	        6.01	    false	        The difference of 0.71 is too big (> eps)
5.00000001	5.00000003	true	        The difference 0.00000002 < eps
5.00000005	5.00000001	true	        The difference 0.00000004 < eps
-0.0000007	0.00000007	true	        The difference 0.00000077 < eps
-4.999999	-4.999998	false	        Border case. The difference 0.000001 == eps. We consider the numbers are different.
4.999999	4.999998	false	        Border case. The difference 0.000001 == eps. We consider the numbers are different.*/
